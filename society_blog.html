                <h3>Not So New Social Movement</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>Our society is now facing a new unprecedented reality where what was once normal is now a faraway memory. The main question many of us are asking ourselves is one of two options: when will things go back to normal?
                or, will things ever go back to normal?</p>
                <p>Our reality as humans is that things are continuously changing and will always be an unavoidable part of life. In our lifetime, no one really considered that we would be going through all this, and how one event would turn everything upside down,
                but as such with all other changes, the adjustment period feels just as long and painful. These months have not only been marked by a pandemic but also by a constant debate about polarization, social justice and the benefits of more cohesive policies
                that would benefit society, regardless of belief, appearance or place of birth.</p>
                <p>Currently the biggest movement that is being seen worldwide and covered on the news is the meaning of Black Lives Matter (BLM) which has led to difficult conversations. This movement is not just a hashtag. No, it doesn’t mean that black lives are more important than other ethnicities.
                It simply means that they need our help so everybody can see and understand that they matter as equally as all others. BLM has been around for a while, but recently it has erupted with more power and being embraced not only locally or nationally, but we’ve gotten to see multiple
                generations united on demonstrations all over the world. This movement has made people realize of the problem our societies are facing and that it’s a sad reality not only here in the U.S.A, but all around them within their own societies.</p>
                <p>The movement not only brings up the issue of overall injustice and the need to explore and study what has been happening around us. Now more than ever it is time to read about our history, study the blueprints our ancestors have left us and listen to podcasts.
                Unfortunately, social injustice is not noticed by everyone and prior to our “new normal” we all had things splitting up our focus, it being work, school or even hobbies and sport events, but what happens when all those things are shifted, or even cancelled? Now that most of us are at home,
                we got the chance to stop all the unnecessary every day noise from our old routines and grasp what’s really happening around us so we could realize that violations in civil rights and liberties is nothing new, especially for those members of society that are part of a minority. 
                Since the world was at home under strict rules of quarantine, they saw the murder of George Floyd.</p>
                <p>Everyone is entitled to have their own opinion and we are encouraged to do so we can all grow a better understanding of our surroundings, but has the media gone too far on trying to push their own views instead of discussing what the issue at hand is? That is competently up to you as the reader to decide. 
                When the riots and protest started happening, they were being broadcasted not as a show of unity working to fight an injustice, but instead they were focusing on anything else they could judge the protesters over. Why are people protesting, aren't they afraid of Covid-19? They were unable to wrap their minds
                around how pissed of a person can to be to risk their own lives and break social distance to organize for a common cause.<p>                
                <p>For people who have never been part of a movement, they think that protests should have a proper etiquette, such as being calm, quiet, walking on a straight line, and not vandalizing property; they even go as far as quoting leaders like Martin Luther King who often said do it with nonviolence. He also once said that sometimes
                riots are a necessary evil. I am not endorsing violence by any means, what I am saying is that protesting isn’t just an act of marching, but is a call to inject new strategies to old movements. Society never behaves in a straight line and sometimes shaking the very floor is necessary to bring about change.
                An advice would simply be to be a part of society and protest the way you feel comfortable. Protesting is not only going outside, but it can take many forms, you just have to find which form appeals to you.<p>        		
                <p>Grassroots organizations are continually forming for this and even thought our society has had to adjust how we interact with each other and are now utilizing technology like Zoom, FaceTime and Google meet, they are still making the movements happen. The BLM movement requires unity, a vision and most importantly,
                discipline in order to survive; these are still alive and hopefully it does not slow down until the change needed in our society is achieved. The question for you would be: What do you stand for? You might think that being neutral is okay or that you’re just one person so it won’t make a difference, but what if
                everybody thought that way? What would happen is this was affecting you or your loved ones? Would it matter then?</p>
